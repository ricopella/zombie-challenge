# Zombie Challenge

In this game, you and a zombie will each be given a certain amount of health. (Perhaps: You 70, Zombie 50).

For each round, you will be asked to guess a random number between 1 and 5.
If your guess matches the random number of the Zombie -- you inflict a random amount of damage between 1 and 5. 
If your guess does not match the random number of the Zombie -- the Zombie inflicts a random amount of damage to you between 1 and 5.
Each round the zombie is given a new random number and you must guess again. 

The game ends when you or the zombie gets to 0 health.
